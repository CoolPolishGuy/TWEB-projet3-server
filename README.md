# TWEB-projet3-server

## Server
During this project we had to build an application with a structure of client-server side.

If you want to launch our server locally you can git clone our repository and then you need to have a 
few tools installed such as NodeJS mainly.
´´´
git clone https://github.com/CoolPolishGuy/TWEB-projet3-server.git
´´´
once you are inside and you have all the tools ready. You can sart the server with this command.
´´´
grunt
´´´
You now have a server running and you can see the port he is listening on.
